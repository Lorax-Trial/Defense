    <h2>Paragraphs: Once-Ler</h2>
    <br />
    <p class="indent">The Once-Ler was trying to make a Thneed. The Thneed could be an umbrella, a bed sheet, a table cloth, anything like that! Though to do that, he had to cut down alot of trees. The Lorax didn't like that. The Once-Ler and the Lorax fought alot. Then, the last tree got cut down. All the animals had to go far away. The Lorax lifted himself up into the sky.</p>
    <br />
    <p class="indent">Once-Ler and Lorax were friends in part of the movie. The end, to be exact. In the book, they weren't friends at all. Not one single bit.</p>

    <h2>Paragraphs: Once-Ler's Mom</h2>
    <br />
    <p class="indent">The Once-Ler's mom always made fun of Once-Ler when he thought about the Thneed. When he set off to find materials for the Thneed, his Mom made fun of him even more. When he got all the materials, his mom actually helped him. That is, until he cut down the last tree. Then, his mom went away.</p>
    <br />
    <p class="indent">Once-Ler's mom was in part of the beginning of the movie. She was also in part of the middle. Before she went away after the last tree was cut down, that is. In the book, she doesn't appear.</p>
