    <h2>Paragraphs: Once-Ler</h2>
    <br />
    <p class="indent">The Once-Ler was trying to make a Thneed. The Thneed could be an umbrella, a bed sheet, a table cloth, anything like that! Though to do that, he had to cut down alot of trees. The Lorax didn't like that. The Once-Ler and the Lorax fought alot. Then, the last tree got cut down. All the animals had to go far away. The Lorax lifted himself up into the sky.</p>
