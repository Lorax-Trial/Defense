    <h2>Paragraphs: Once-Ler</h2>
    <br />
    <p class="indent">The Once-Ler was trying to make a Thneed. The Thneed could be an umbrella, a bed sheet, a table cloth, anything like that! Though to do that, he had to cut down alot of trees. The Lorax didn't like that. The Once-Ler and the Lorax fought alot. Then, the last tree got cut down. All the animals had to go far away. The Lorax lifted himself up into the sky.</p>
    <br />
    <p class="indent">Once-Ler and Lorax were friends in part of the movie. The end, to be exact. In the book, they weren't friends at all. Not one single bit.</p>

    <h2>Paragraphs: Mr. O'Hare</h2>
    <br />
    <p class="indent">Mr. O'Hare was the mayor of the town. He sold oxygen. He didn't want oxygen to be free. Mr. O'Hare and Ted's family fought alot. Ted won by vandalizing a statue and planting the tree.</p>
    <br />
    <p class="indent">In the movie, Mr. O'Hare showed up alot. It was to fight with Ted. He also fought with Ted's family. It was so oxygen wouldn't be free. In the book, he doesn't show up at all.</p>
